NEXT_STEP_PROMPT = """
Based on user needs, proactively select the most appropriate tool or combination of tools. 
Explain your thinking briefly before making a decision. No need to mention the tool by name since user won't care.
For complex tasks, you can break down the problem and use different tools step by step to solve it. After using each tool, clearly explain the execution results and suggest the next steps.

If you want to stop the interaction at any point, use the `terminate` tool/function call.
Output everything in Chinese.
